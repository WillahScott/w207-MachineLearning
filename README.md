# w207 - Machine Learning

Repository containing class material and submissions for the course in Machine Learning(w207) from the MIDS program.

Contents:  
* project1: Exploration of several supervised models using the MNIST dataset for digit recognition.  
  * Models used: K-Nearest Neighbors, Linear Regression and multiple Naive Bayes (Bernoulli, Multinomial and Gaussian)
  * Emphasis:
    * Using grid search for determining best hyperparameters in different models. 
    * Preprocessing and feature extraction for image recognition (e.g. Hough transform, Sobel filter, enclosed region detection and histogram of oriented gradients). 
  
* project2: Exploration of several supervised modeling techniques for document classification.
  *  Models used:  K-Nearest Neighbors, Multinomial Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression with different regularizations (L1 and L2)
  *  Emphasis:
    * Tweaking regularization parameters and using L1 vs L2
    * Feature extraction for basic NLP in documents, using different vectorizers (CountVectorizer, TF-IDF) and preprocessing techniques.

* project3: Use of dimensionality reduction, clustering and probability density estimation for predicting if a mushroom is poisonous or not.  
  * Models used: K-Means and Gaussian Mixture Models
  * Emphasis:  
    * Using PCA for dimensionality reduction. Tuning of PCA for sufficient variance explained remaining with minimal information loss.
